      <p class="p1-text"><strong>Personal Information:</strong></p>
      <p class="p1-text"><strong><em>Le Phuc Thinh - S3893964:</em></strong></p>
      <p class="p1-text">My name is Thinh, I was born in Ho Chi Minh city. I am a big foodie and my passion in IT came to me during college when my friend suggested it to me. I attend RMIT because I think this school will provide me with a good learning experience. My experience in IT includes knowledge about basic python programming, user centered design and SQL database.
        Test results:

        </div>
      </p>
        <p class="p1-text">I think the result shows that as a teammate I will work on my part well but also I can provide some good insights and ideas about the project. The high agreeableness, openness mean that I am willing to listen to other ideas but problems may arise when there are too many suggestions and I can’t tell which one is best. I might just agree with most of them while not knowing the best one. So my ideal teammate would be people who stimulate me intellectually and have good self discipline</p>
        <p class="p1-text">Ideal job: I want to be a game developer because I love how you can create digital products and you could say that you make it your own.</p>
        <p class="p1-text"><strong><em>Dang Hoang Tuan - S3891494:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p1-text">My name is Tuan, I was born in Can Tho and then relocated to Ho Chi Minh city when I was 2. I am an optimistic person, I like having fun with my friends and spending time with my family. Also, the passion in IT has been growing when I approached virtual technology and computing. It is exciting to attend RMIT, the most popular technology university, to exploit my passion and discover the person I am.

          </div>
        <p class="p1-text">According to the results, I am a walk the talk person and concentrate on detail, also I am open minded to everything. I believe this would benefit my teammate and this assignment by my hard working and my careful personal’s trait.</p>
        <p class="p1-text">Ideal job: 
          In the future I want to be a security analyst because I like investigating problems like a detective but also coding. Also, I’m quite fond of protecting other people so maybe I will do my best to pursue security analysis. 
          </p>
          <p class="p1-text"><strong><em>Duong Dinh Long - S3836210:</em></strong></p>
          <p class="p1-text">I am Long, a member of the Spidermen team. I come from Ha Tinh, a province in centre Vietnam. I love music, like playing football and especially video games, which motivates and guides me to the path of Information Technology. I don’t currently have great IT experience, but I am confident with my writing and logical skills, which would help me not only in the IT field, but also in different aspects of life.Test results:</p>

          <p class="p1-text">I believe that the results of the test, which describes me as a responsible and listening person, would benefit the group. Also, with results, it can be easier for me to observe new information as well as sharing empathy. Last but not least, my traits allow me to be a planner for the group to achieve the goal and get good results.</p>
          <p class="p1-text">Ideal jobs: Data Analyst-
            I want to be a Data Analyst in the future. I am confident in my analytical and logical skills as well as the ability to work with data. This would be a difference since my teammates here are going to a more practical work and relating more about computers than me. Whereas my ideal job would also relate more to business than the IT own’s field.

      <h2 class="parts" id="part1"><u>Part 3: IT Work</u></h2>
      <p>Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, many people, including IT professionals have changed their working environment, from working from businesses or organisations to working mainly from home. Despite this has affected their behaviour and daily routine, the peculiarity of IT professional jobs seem to remain nearly the same as the pre-covid stage. To be more specific, these ten videos below will demonstrate how the jobs of IT professionals would be. As the field of Information Technology is large, the types of IT professional jobs in the below videos would also be divided into different areas that lie under the umbrella of IT jobs, from IT systems administrators, to programmers and so on.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>IT system and project managers:</u></Strong></p>
      <p><strong>Video 1: </strong></p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfAcLjgQUcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>This video is from PushToProd channel, it focuses on a field in IT, specifically IT systems admin. Video character is EM, an IT system admin. His job is to communicate with other teams, including security team, scripting team as well, in order to make sure that the new process, which is operated mainly by window powershell, runs correctly. He would try to automate the process using powershell to increase the intelligence of the process. Speaking of powershell, one of EM’s co-worker has stated that windows powershell will become one of the most popular programming languages applied due to its friendly interface and low difficulty. The IT system administrator is a quite challenging position since it requires the admin to work with many different co-workers and as EM stated in the video: “You have to put on different heads”, this can clearly describe the difficulty of the job. </p>

      <p>A video of Enzoy Zee talking about what an IT manager's day would look like. He started the morning with some work-outs and checked his emails afterwards. He then had two meetings on Scum with his teams, talking about how to improve the web application and user interface. In this video, working from home seems easy for him because of the relaxation. Despite being a boomer, he still can bring his enthusiasm into his job.</p>

      <p>This video talks about a day in the life of Kalle Hallden, a programmer. His job is to develop an application, and the day to day task is looking for a better method of programming and fixing several errors. He feels productive in the morning and making breakfast disturbs his feeling so he works until noon and then has his first meal. In the afternoon, he was trying to create an Intelligent Artificial bot which provides gamers better performance in gameplay, specifically Fortnine. His hobbies during free time are jogging and cooking, he spends most of his spare time with his girlfriend. Everyday, Kalle Hallden tries to find new habits which productively affect his work like reading books and inner peace.</p>

      <p>In this video, Utsav - a software engineer will review a day in life. His morning started up with breakfast and exercise to warm up his body and mind. After that, he got to work at home by checking email, updating tasks, reviewing meeting agendas and reviewing daily goals. After lunch, he drove to the office and tried to finish the rest of the work. From here, he did some coding (API implementation), adding some rest APIS to sync up some Telemetry. After a few hours of working, he drove home and took a bit of rest. By the end of the day, Utsav reviewed the work and wrapped up a day by hanging out with his friends. Everything seems easy but it is not. To spend a number of hours on screen, Utsav has many different good habits to maintain a fresh mind at work.

      <p>The video is from Stefanovic, a data analyst. As for his job, he started working by communicating with his team, which includes other data analysts to work on data. To be more specific, his team would work with the dashboard, debugging it or run new functionalities to make sure whether the data is displayed correctly. Besides communicating with colleagues, he also spends time with clients to explain the problems, and he stated that most of the time in the conversations with his clients is just because of the data source problems. It is easy to see that data analyst jobs not only require people to have great skills about data, but also the communication skills, which would make the process of explaining problems to clients easier.</p>

      <p>This is also a video from Stefanovic, where he describes his first start to become a data analyst. He explained that at first, he was not a data analyst, and he entered this field due to his recognition that he was not suitable for his previous job. He also provided some tools to help people in the path of becoming a data analyst, which includes Microsoft Excel, python,... Furthermore, he mentioned that analytical and highly adapted mindsets are the requirement to work in this field due to its dynamic challenge, which consists of new tools or programming languages to catch up with the fast increase of daily data.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Cyber security:</u></Strong></p>

      <p>The video is from Talmage Kelley, a young cybersecurity engineer and the video is about a day of his life. In the morning, he was working on the security scanner, which scans the vulnerabilities for the devices and networks for the whole company. The scanner is called OpenVAS. He worked with two monitors, one of them showed a Discord channel which helped him to communicate with his colleagues or maybe clients. In the afternoon, he was trying to find out the root of a problem that caused the server to not function properly. He then found out the problem was that the OpenVAS did not interact well with the operating systems.

      This video represents a day in the life of a software engineer at Disney. Tommy Mallow who works at Los Angeles had a unique daily routine of a game developer. He started the day with breakfast and watering the plants, then went surfing on a nearby beach; after that, he got to work at 9:45 in the morning. The workspace is filled up with cozy rooms and a numerous high end machine which relate to games. Tommy Mallow’s first things to do in work are email checking and game coding. After that he discussed with his friends aka artist for the upcoming projects then went for lunch. In the afternoon, he had a brief meeting with his colleagues and kept working until 6:00 pm. At the end of the day, he had fun with some friends and headed to bed. The challenges he faces during work is his concentration, thankfully his refreshed morning routine is a great motivation to start a hard working day<p></p>
      <p><Strong>Conclusion: </Strong></p>
      <p>Overall, the videos have described many types of IT professional jobs and the IT professionals’ ages are also different. This proves that IT jobs are emerging and can be adopted by many generations, from boomers to millennials. Furthermore, they have interacted with a lot of different people, however, it seems that the people that they are most communicating with are the co-workers, partners and colleagues. The videos also mentioned the difficulty of the jobs, ther skills and experiences required for a specific IT job also vary, from analytical, logic skills to experiences at applications such as Excel and at programming languages such as Python or Windows powershell.</p>
      <h2 class="parts" id="part1"><u>Part 4: IT Technologies</u></h2>
      <h3><Strong><u>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</u></Strong></h3>
      <p>We are living in an incredibly interesting age, where technologies in artificial intelligence, machine learning are growing exponentially and inevitably reaching godlike intelligence. Most people with access to technology use it almost everyday yet very few know how it works or the future of it. Elon musk said that in the short term as automation gets so advanced that the economy will change vastly, to deal with unemployment when robots replace workers we might even need to shift to universal basic income where the unemployed are paid. In the future he said that super artificial intelligence is very scary and should be regulated. He gave an example where he thinks that artificial intelligence will be much more dangerous than nuclear weapons but right now nuclear weapons are regulated but not artificial intelligence. </p>
      <p><Strong><u>So what does it do?</u></Strong></p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is basically when you teach a baby computer how to think like a machine. For example, you can give it a game and the rules and it will play it and figure out by itself the best way to beat it. The term machine learning is when the machine learns from its experiences through trials and errors. Currently, the latest advancement in AI technology are artificial general intelligence (AGI) where machines reach human-like levels of intelligence at certain tasks, conversational AI is used oftenly in natural language processing which give birth to popular online chatbots, machine learning provided us self driving cars, making medical diagnoses, machine that play games like Alpha Zero, neutral networks where the technology is design like the human brain which have been used and improved Apple’s siri and another new generation of AI which is deep learning where machine taught it self how to process non-text data like voice or images. “There are four types of AI that differ in their complexity of abilities: reactive machines use previous data to draw conclusions for current decisions, such as a chess AI; limited memory uses live data to read a situation and make decisions, such as self-driving cars, theory of mind is something we haven’t reached yet, and deals with AI understanding that every entity has its own set of underlying concepts — such as motives, intentions and emotions; self-awareness is the final stage of AI, where an AI can not only understand others’ consciousness (theory of mind) but also has a concept of its own existence” (Insider Inc, 2020). As you can see, there are tons of quality of life and improvements in many different areas that AI can help us. For example, voice recognition systems like Seri, Alexa, chatbots, healthcare, banking, logistics and virtually every business use AI to provide recommendations and ideas in some ways. For the near future as deep learning get more advance we see facial recognition tools so powerful that it might get use on crime suspect to match with video, picture evidence to determine if the suspect is guilty or not; when machine learning improve drastically in the next few years we might be able to have a network of self driving cars where stoplight and speed bumps will be obsolete because cars can communicate with each other for the perfect traffic flow. “In the comparatively AI-nascent field of healthcare, diseases are more quickly and accurately diagnosed, drug discovery is sped up and streamlined, virtual nursing assistants monitor patients and big data analysis helps to create a more personalized patient experience. Textbooks are digitized with the help of AI, early-stage virtual tutors assist human instructors and facial analysis gauges the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored and better tailor the experience to their individual needs” (Mike Thomas 2021, para 9).</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Impact:</u></Strong></p>
      <p>The impact that AI technology has on humanity is huge. For different areas it could be more effective work or even break through. The amazing thing about AI is that it learns by playing itself it can crush world champions in certain games, not even that but it also destroys machines that developers spend years to create. In the game departments AIs have inspired  human players with their strategy. For example the world chess champion of 2021 Magnus Carles has a chess ELO of 2800+ but an AI like AphaZero is rated 3500+, the way that machines play chess is very different and much better than humans. Top chess grandmasters have used chess engines to study lines in chess. Transportation will see big changes as of right now we already have self driving cars, traffic would change in a way we never thought, maybe in the future traffic laws will change entirely or does not even exist as everybody vehicles are self driving and connected. Space exploration will become easier, machines will be able to calculate and give more accurate results than humans can. In the near future, when AGI advances, easy tasks that machines can do will render human workers obsolete. This will create huge structural changes in the economy. Large numbers of workers will lose their jobs to machines and we will see a big wave of structural unemployment. In the far future we will need to be very careful about regulating AI. We need to think about whether or shouldn’t we should create super artificial intelligence and if we decide to do so then we need to make sure that the AI won’t harm us. The possibilities of skynet are real but right now AI is far from that level of intelligence, so we shouldn't be afraid but still very cautious. Since machine learning is exponentially growing when a machine is conscious and has human intelligence, it will become much smarter than everyone on earth combined very fast.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Impact on individual:</u></Strong></p>
      <p>“As I already know that AI is already everywhere around us, I think it will be very beneficial for me to learn about it more. First of all is that for a career prospect this area is extremely promising and the market for it is growing rapidly. I think that the most important thing about AI is how we can ultimately utilise it and if I am still alive when AI reaches consciousness, how we can prevent it from controlling us. From the consumer point of view, AI technology provides me with great perks and quality of life improvements. I think that in the future with self-driving cars I can take trips with friends where all of us can be sleeping on the road. I think that my daily life will change drastically when everything around us is connected to AI like smart tv, smart phone. I think that personally it would be hard for me to go back to living without AI, it's like when you get to drive an expensive car it’s hard to get around with a bike. Mentally I think AI really puts into perspective how people overestimate themselves, people are really dumber than what they think. This is because as AI is getting better they are outclassing humans in those aspects” - Thinh,</p>
      <h3><Strong><u>Natural Language processing and chatterbots:</u></Strong></h3>
      <p>As the world is experiencing a rapid increase of population and a fast development of technology, the data that needs to be collected and processed inherently becomes heavier. Therefore, the world has developed an artificial intelligence program that can understand, collect, and make use of large amounts of data from human language, including two most prominent forms, speech and text, this is called Natural Language Processing, or NLP in short. There are many uses of NLP in the world, Google Translate could be an example for it. The computer can collect data from a sentence of a language, and translate that sentence into any different languages. Basically, NLP is the ability given to computers so that they can perform human works, which was impossible for them to do in the past. As NLP is developing at a fast speed, many individuals and organizations have started applying NLP in many different fields, including Chatbots to collect data, improve customer engagement, and increase profits.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Functions:</u></Strong></p>
      <p>Different from the past, when chatbots could only process simple data and answer simple questions, chatbots nowadays can answer some questions which are way more complicated thanks to the application of NLP. According to statistics from IBM, 80% of normal daily questions can be answered easily by chatbots, the other 20% require higher training activities (Jovic 2020). However, this is enough to prove that chatbots can now answer almost all of the normal questions that in the past, only humans could do. By showing their usefulness to the modern world, chatbots are now being more and more implied and used by organizations. Specifically, statistics from Aqquire shows that more than 1.4 billion people use chatbots for daily tasks, proving their popularity (Jovic 2020). 
        Besides the “classic” text-to-text interaction between humans and chatbots, speech-to-text or speech-to-speech could also be the ways to communicate with them. These ways of communication allow the bots to work as virtual assistants, rather than just question-and-answers bots. This has been applied to many devices with different operating systems and organisations, such as Alexa for Amazon, Siri for Apple, Bixby for Samsung or Cortana for Microsoft. Not only translating languages or answering text questions, they can understand human speech and from there manipulate the devices to perform daily tasks such as create schedules, set alarms, check emails and so on.
        Overall, chatterbots now have developed beyond their own “chatterbots” terminology. However, they still have downsides, such as giving wrong information, or not understanding customers' needs. This sounds very normal with individuals and small corporations, but can be a real problem with the big ones because it will not only affect customer engagement, but also drag down the reputation of the companies. Therefore, researching and improving NLP is also one of the top priorities of organisations in order to provide more accurate information for the end-users. 
        In the near future, chatbots have the potential to develop even further. Since the social media channels are becoming more popular, chatbots inherently, will be applied to their system. Facebook Messenger, Instagram or Whatsapp have been great environments for bots to thrive. Furthermore, with the effort of improving NLP quality, chatbots in the near future can become more sentimental and understandable in different users' contexts and perhaps different users’ languages (Kelley 2019). Last but not least, the improvement in artificial intelligence and machine learning is crucial in order to create not only smart, but also trendy and trustworthy chatbots. 
        </p>
        <p><Strong><u>Impact of development:</u></Strong></p>
        <p>The thrivingness of chatbots affects many fields of life. Since they can work 24/7, after asking questions, customers can receive the answers immediately. Due to the increase in customer engagement, chatbots have saved billions of dollars for many organizations, especially financial institutions such as banks. In 2019, chatbots have saved 127 million dollars just in the bank sector (Martin 2020). In 2022, as a result of the increase in chatbots popularity, they are expected to save businesses more than 8 billion dollars (Deloitte n.d). 
          With the development of messaging apps, people will not only be able to ask questions through those apps, but also do more higher-level actions such as making bank payments. Moreover, the improvement in NLP and AI technology is going to be a great contribution, chatbots will be able to listen better. As a result, this could change people’s behaviour. Instead of paying by using credit cards, SMS or QR codes, people would be able to pay for their products just by some simple conversations with bots on Facebook Messenger or any other messaging apps.
          In the future, besides the financial advantages that chatbots can provide, many other sectors such as education and healthcare, the sectors that require fast answers, would also be beneficial from the bots as well. For education, chatbots have been working as teaching assistants, and with the great potential of NLP, they shall further understand not only one, but multiple languages. Therefore, chatbots will be able to individually support students from different countries and on a larger scale (Winkler, Rainer & Söllner, Matthias 2018). Chatbots could also assist hospitals and patients since they can help booking appointments, recording patient profiles or making medical diagnosis. 
          However, due to their abilities to support multiple industries, chatbots could also be one of the reasons leading to the redundancy of jobs in the future. Taking taxi and bus drivers as an example, automated vehicles have already been used recently. With future development, it is easy for cars or buses to move with voice or chat commands rather than human drivers. According to the Los Angeles Times, in the next 10 years, 1.7 million trucks will become fully automated (Deskmukh 2021). Another example is manufacturing progressions, which will also be fully automated due to the advanced chatbots.

      <p>“Honestly, My family and I have not used chatbots very much despite their great potential. However, this might change in the future due to their popularity. Firstly, chatbots would help me to be able to do online purchasing faster and more time-efficiently since I can use voice or text commands. Secondly, as stated above, the development of NLP is also a key reason for chatbots to be able to understand multiple languages in multiple contexts. Hence, this would benefit me when I am reading different languages, or communicating with friends from different countries. As for my family, it is possible that many products in our house would be automated, such as refrigerators, televisions, washing machines or microwave ovens, these can be manipulated by my parents smart-phones, this would be less time-consuming and more convenient so that my parents could save more time to do different tasks. Chatbots will also improve the engagement between me and my friends, with the further development of social media and messaging apps, as well as chatbots, we will be able to communicate easier and faster. For example, chatbots can work as a third friend who will receive a question or answer from me, after that, it will process and simplify that question or answer, and give it to my friend to ensure maximum understanding.” - Long.

      <h3><Strong><u>Cybersecurity and privacy:</u></Strong></h3>
      <p>As our world is being reshaped by digital technologies, the status quo will continue to be disrupted. Technological advancements can lead to greater societal and economic benefits, but they also bring new security challenges. Defending networks, computers, and programs from digital attacks is called cybersecurity. Most of these attacks are targeted at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive data; extorting money from users; or disrupting normal business operations.Because there are more devices than people, and attackers are increasingly innovative, it can be challenging to implement effective cybersecurity measures. Multiple layers of protection are used as part of a successful cybersecurity approach. Those layers protect computers, networks, programs, and data. To create an effective defense against cyber attacks, people, processes, and technology must complement each other(Cisco nd)
        There are a variety of prominent, emerging, and resurgent cybersecurity risks and threats currently, so a new form of securing and protecting your data online has been created: cybersecurity and privacy. There are many forms of cybersecurity: infrastructure security(traffic light,...),application security(antivirus app,...), network security(password, application security), cloud security( Cloud is becoming popular due to improved cyber security), and IoT security( sensors, camera,...).(Mindcore 2018)
        </p>
        <p><Strong><u>Functions:</u></Strong></p>
        <p>One of the biggest changes in the cyber security industry over the past 20 years has been its ubiquity.There was no mainstream industry for cyber security just 10 years ago. It was generally believed that only large organizations could be targets and that there was no such position as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)."It was a space that barely existed a decade ago, and what was accessible was uninteresting, unscientific, and ineffective," Cybsafe creator Oz Alashe concurred.In the previous half-century, cryptography has gone a long way; the discovery of the RSA algorithm in the 1970s was a watershed moment. Encryption and decryption may now be done with separate keys thanks to RSA. It also completely transformed the field.(Logan 2019)
          The dominant idea in the cyber security business for a long time was to add more obstacles – more layers of complexity – to technology. It was argued that cyber criminals would have a difficult time breaking into sophisticated systems with multiple barriers to entry."[It] was predominantly seen as a forensic and reactive industry," Red Sift co-founder Randal Pinto says of historical cyber security. The solutions were costly, and they relied on paying consultants to look into and remedy the faults that led to a cyber attack.Increasingly in contemporary cyber security, psychology and behavioural science is as important as coding and adversaries get more creative and sophisticated in their methods. Cybsafe, a member of the Cyber 1.0 cohort, provide the world’s first intelligent cyber security awareness, behaviour and culture risk management solution, fusing psychology and behavioural science with artificial intelligence and data science(Logan 2019)
          </p>
      <p><Strong><u>Impact of development:</u></Strong></p>
      <p>One of  the most popular forms of cyber security is password.Social networking accounts, online banking, mobile phone PINs, and email accounts are just a few examples of applications and platforms that require passwords nowadays. Although having so many password protection protocols may appear cumbersome, these protocols serve as the first line of defense against cyber thieves and hackers.Cyber security plays a major role in maintaining and developing a compliance culture, which is one of the biggest effects cybersecurity has on us. A compliance culture embeds awareness training and risk mitigation into our everyday work practices, setting the standard for good conduct throughout the entire organisation.(deltanet nd)
        Also, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just limited to robots carrying out household duties for us, such as mowing the lawn.  Cyber criminals and cybersecurity teams are increasingly using artificial intelligence approaches. Artificial intelligence is going to play a very significant role in cybersecurity in the future.(Goddard 2021)
        In the future, those who work in computer security and the protection of data networks will benefit from studying Cyber Security. This subject would be valuable for individuals who aspire to join government organizations like the National Informatics Centre (NIC), National Technical Research Organization (NTRO), and National Investigation Agency (NIA). Additionally, cyber forensics, cybercrime investigation, and cyberlaw professionals will find it useful. Also, the candidate will be able to find a job in the fields of computer science, information technology, information security, coding, and cryptography.(Information Security Today nd)
          Cybersecurity Ventures predicted that by 2021 there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally, up from one million in 2014. According to the New York Times, this figure is reverberating across the cybersecurity community. Despite industry-wide attempts to close the skills gap, the projection has come true, with 50 NFL stadiums worth of unfilled cybersecurity opportunities in 2021.(Morgan 2021)

      <p>“In the past when I was new to the internet, I was very annoyed by all the procedure like using email and phone number to bind an account and set up the strong password  for video game or social media because I though that can we just access them directly on my device, but after losing many gaming and social media account( mainly because I forgot my password or get hacked when I logged into the hacker web page or click on dangerous link), I realize the importance of those procedure, thank to them i manage to recover the accounts. I have really developed an awareness about cyber security since then. Now I only trust online services that have strict register procedures, especially those that require your confidential information like credit card details or your address. This mindset will protect me from any cybercrime in the future. About my family, they know very little about the internet, to be more specific the cyber crime, especially my grandparents, so they are very annoyed by the strict cyber security procedure when using online services like online banking, shopping service. But I believe that these procedures protect people who are vulnerable to cyber crime like them and I hope they can realize the importance of cyber security one day” - Khoi.</p>
      <h3><Strong><u>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</u></Strong></h3> 
      <p>As the emergence of technology and digital information, the majority of day-to-day activities are functioned by the apex of robotic and high-end technology. While traditional money has several insecure disadvantages, blockchain and cryptocurrency becomes a vital transaction globally contributing to a thriving economy in a virtual way.</p> 
      <p><Strong><u>Functions:</u></Strong></p>
      <p>What is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system which does not need verification from the bank in a transaction. The first digital cash coined by Satoshi Nakamoto is bitcoin and is still the most traded recently. The application of cryptocurrency is to utilize the transmitting process’s security, low cost of transfers and non-time deferring, and with the online database storing like blockchain, digital money cannot be more secure. So, what is blockchain? From my experience, blockchain is a chain of blocks that store the information and multiple hosted accounts. A new block created when a customer has a transaction, it will record the history and store it in a block, and it keeps doing the same routine.
        The block connects to another by a ‘chain’, technically it is called a hash, created by an algorithm in order to make it unique. The hash is also a key factor to open and modify the information inside the blockchain framework. This makes blockchain impossible to be invaded and scammed by hackers because if one change is made without verification from the host, the whole system will be alerted. There are also Miners who build a new block on chain, the mining process is complicated due to the algorithm hashes are required to be before a new block is added in. After that, miners will receive their rewards financially. The most crucial technology of blockchain is decentralization, which means there is no individual or organization owning the blockchain. The host information of the block will be connected to the chain via the nodes which could be any technology that stores copies of the blockchain and keeps it working.
         With the breakthrough of blockchain and cryptocurrency, the needs of third parties are no longer involved between the two who are transacting, this solves the long and complicated process of trading. Every user can get a copy of Blockchain, a distributed database, and add new records as long as the permission is still valid. This proves a true work due to the unchangeable data inside the block and when combined with cryptocurrency, it creates a secure and high-speed transmitting playground for investors and highly demanding privacy occupations involved.
        These Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, ETH remain unstable in price on the marketplace and willing to be changed anytime. At present, I would say that cryptocurrency is unpredictable to claim what would happen to the worldwide market in the next 3 years, but I believe that digital money will stand a better chance of driving the economy to a higher level and being an opportunity for poor socio-economic background countries. (Finextra 2019)
        In the future, with the evolution of technology, many science applications and high-tech devices will be improved, blockchain and cryptocurrency are not least. With the enhancement in the power of Artificial intelligence, Cloud, Container, Internet of thing and Machine learning. They will act as a precursor in proving the functional blockchain and crypto to worldwide.

      <p><Strong><u>Impact of development:</u></Strong></p>
      <p>Since the first invention of digital money in 2009, Bitcoin, the new form of currency gradually gravitated people toward itself because of its autonomous and convenient nature (Kaleb Davis 2021). Cryptocurrency has made it easier to do business by widening the assessment to an international marketplace for entrepreneurs, rather than just limiting the development of the national market.
        Digital money has always been a topic of interest and it will not be changed easily, let alone the rapid change of face value of the cryptocurrency at the moment. If there is any progress in the favor of digital money, it would be a development of blockchain and cryptocurrency inexorably advancing to a new peak and even making it more common in trading of business.
        Many people are attracted to cryptocurrency and blockchain, regardless of their age group or financial background. Cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin, Bitcoin, ETH is a ‘black gold’ for risky investors. Some claim that crypto would make an underprivileged be a millionaire after one night, some say that crypto is just a passing fad. According to CNN money, as digital cash increasingly becomes a hot trend, young people are gradually drawn to this virtual payment (Anna Bahney 2018). Unfortunately, shortage of investing experience makes their investment vulnerable and results in failure. Furthermore, an individual application containing information, blockchain, will gravitate all the user's attention due to its convenience. Blockchain is what cloud is supposed to be – a prestigious transmitting of information and peer to peer network, it solves tons of security problems due to proof of work, which cloud is not capable of.
        ‘Every investor should buy crypto’, says digital currency index founder (Bronner 2018)

      <p>“I’m currently just a student, and my financial status does not have a chance to give Bitcoin a shot. However, as a future IT engineer, cryptocurrency is fertile land for me to exploit and invest in. Without any doubt, the technology of digital money has changed the method of payment. It provided convenience not only for entrepreneurs but also for me. It is very dangerous going around the city while holding a bag of money. Therefore, digital payment wipes out the barrier of unsecure public and far faster transmitting than physical cash. First of all, this crypto technology changes my school of thought of the global economy, and this would affect my future life when I start exploring more. Furthermore, the discovery of blockchain made me understand deeper about the important security concept of containing information.Now I would like to learn how to use blockchain in order to improve information technology skills and for more purposes. In my family, this technology also influences my sister and my mom, they say that this might be a chance to be a second earning resource. But the security and no third parties’ policy turn out to be questionable at best for my friend and my family. They claim that blockchain and crypto are too new for them to catch up, and too risky to invest all the assets in. Therefore, digital money will be available when I am totally adult and when I have considerable income from my main job.” - Tuan.</p>
      <h2 class="parts" id="part1"><u>Part 5: Project Ideas</u></h2>
      <p>Our project is about to create an open world game, which can be manipulated not only by devices, but also voice commands. In order to make the game function well, we divided the tasks for different teams, each team would carry a part of the game. There is a programming and designing team, a data team, and a security team.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Design team :</u></Strong></p>
      <p>The design game position will be in charge of every aspect of design which may be different based on what game the team is going to make. There are several kinds of design, with lower game requirements, the positions are game design and level design. With the project we would like to do in future, we must have a system designer, gameplay designer, mission designer and openworld designer,...  The person who is a game designer is responsible for planning new mechanics and framework in game, after the approval from other members, this member will make it more specific. The level designers take the idea from the game designer, then create the map and structures in the game. The ‘’greybox’’ is a technology that we use to make a level, in which we can be creative by combining blocks and other material to make the building more realistic. During the process, we must have strong bonding communication and encourage each other, the team must know more about each other and think the same thing so that we can design in the most productive mode and better the experience for players. To make an open world game, the design team who are in charge of making characters and maps will use Blender, this software allows users to create realistic figures and building structures; Furthermore, Blender also slightly supports in the field of animation. Emacs will be the tool of system design where the team can function the animations, interactions and transmitting data by coding.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Data team: </u></Strong></p>
      <p>This team will collect data from the users. Particularly, a server is created to store the data from costumes, skins, character customizations, artefacts, enemies, quests and most importantly, the user IDs, which are the primary key that differentiate them with each other. Furthermore, the user data is collected everyday to improve personalization. Voice commands which are most used, are also stored. After the collecting process is completed, each week, the characters that are used will be upgraded to make them more insightful, sentimental and realistic. About the tool that will be used, Javascript and C++ will be used to collect data from both device interaction, which are the commands from keyboards and mouses, and voice interaction, collected from voice commands. The data will be stored by SQL in order to further upgrade the characters. Also, just like other games, we want to collect user feedback as well as the game’s downloads, to find out problems of the game, and this is also stored by SQL as well. If the project is successful, half of the profit will be donated to charity to help poor people.</p>
      <p><Strong><u>Security team: </u></Strong></p>
      <p>For the security aspect of the game, we must ensure that the accounts of every player are protected and can be recovered. To do this, when the player create their account, they must enter the email address and phone number so that when they lost their account due to hacker or they just simply forget their password, they can use email or phone number to change password back(For Example, when they click recover password an OTP code will be send to their email or phone, and by enter that code, they can create the new password).Moreover, when the player create their account we must use encryption method(like RSA) to encrypt the player password and store it with the player username in our database so that even when hacker can somehow access to our database, they can not get any information. We will also inform players frequently about the fake website of the game through mail and remind players about the scam through text that sometimes appears in the corner of the screen. Players can report other players about the bad behavior( especially  scam) so we can block them and protect our community. We will use Denuvo - a game protection and Anti-Privacy technology helping game publishers and developers to secure PC, console and mobile games to prevent people from cracking or hacking our game. By doing this we will make the players in our community feel safe and enjoy playing our game.</p>

      <p>Our group had some difficulties contacting other members of the group from the start so it is difficult to give tasks to the members of the group so we decided to do part 4 first. Luckily the 4th member finally contacted our team not long after and we immediately shared the tasks and tried to finish the project on time. Although our group took a long time to contact each other, everyone was very responsible and tried their best to finish their tasks. The group members were very nice to each other which made me relax while doing the work. Long was very good at finding resources and showing us how to do our part effectively. Tuan was very nice at encouraging us, he always gave an optimistic attitude. Thinh is the last member to contact the group but he has done his work very well and faster than us so that our group can finish the project on time.I myself tried my best to do my part without flaws and also help the group member when they needed.

      <p>Although the members in the team contacted each other quite late, we are still able to finish all the work of the assignment. All of my team members are good listeners that can understand within a few words. This cost me less time to explain and divide the works for them, hence, we can finish the project on time. Tuan and Khoi are very responsible for their work. With Thinh who has just recently joined the group, despite joining late, he has finished his job before the team’s deadline. Overall, I am happy to work and share knowledge with them. Hopefully in the next group assignment, we will keep our good work and be more productive.</p>
      <p><Strong>Dang Hoang Tuan - s3891494:</Strong> </p>
      <p>Even though there were several difficulties in communication with teammates, we overcame the barriers and still accomplished our goal by the deadline. This is because all the team members are open minded and encourage each other in the worst time. One of my team members - Long is an excellent team leader in specifically explaining the work to teammates; although one of the members participated late, Long was still able to lead the team to success. Khoi and Thinh were extremely serious about the assignment, so they got the work finished very early. They also are responsible persons, they did not play around during the work and gave out brilliant ideas during the meeting. To be honest, my hard work pales in comparison with others’ effort and productivity, they put in more energy and do their best to finish the project. I am thankful to have these teammates. </p>

      <p> I had a problem contacting my team on my part so I was a little late to contact the team. However as a teammate I work hard to finish all my responsibilities and I made it in time before the deadline. Beside that problem, the team worked together very well, everyone was happy to help each other. Everyone knows what to do and produce quality work, minor road bumps were easily solved thanks to my teammates communicating. I personally feel bad for my team because I contacted them late but fortunately they didn’t mind at all. We even finished the project one day earlier than we expected. As a team I think we really came together. Tuan was positive, responsive, Khoi was very responsible and Long provided good resources in time of need for the group.</p>
